Ajax App

Make a simple page that holds information about a series (or list) of things - your family or pets, movies, games, books - whatever you like.  Try to select an object that is complex, but not too complex.  Each thing should have a few different pieces of related data that you can group into a simple JSON object.

Structure your object in JSON and provide some starting data - aim for about 5 items.

Then you will need to make a basic HTML5 page and layout that data on the page using JavaScript and jQuery to get the JSON data and build HTML around it.
