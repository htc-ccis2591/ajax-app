My First JavaScript App!

Chapter 7 of your textbook includes a small Address Book example application.

Review this code, and then make a similar application that holds information for something (other than addresses) that you personally care about - your family or pets, movies, games, books - whatever you like.  The address book only holds a name and email.  Try to select an object that is more complex, but not too complex.  Make it interesting though, as you'll work with this for the next assignment as well (and maybe one more...)

You will need to structure your object in JSON and provide some starting data - aim for about 5 items - similar to the contacts object in listing 6.6.

Then you will need to make a basic HTML5 page and layout that data on the page using JavaScript.  This is similar to what you did in the JS-Data asignment to add the two weekly special items.  You should be prepared to share what you have put together as a presentation to the class next week.

In the following weeks we will build on this, so make sure that you have an object structure and HTML layout that is well suited for the information that you are managing. If you have questions, please ask before coming to class next week.
